These are exercises in R to improve my data visualisaton skills. 

I'm primarily using `ggplot2` as the main tool, and pulling in other libraries
as necessary to achieve the outcome, or as close as I can reasonably get.
Needless to say, the "Hadleyverse" is heavily used, to smooth some of the rough
edges of R.
