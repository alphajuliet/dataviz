# dataviz-book

These are exercises in R to improve my data viz skills, mainly by trying to
replicate visualisations in Andy Kirk's book "Data Visualisation - a successful
design process".

I'm primarily using `ggplot2` as the main tool, and pulling in other libraries
as necessary to achieve the outcome, or as close as I can reasonably get.
